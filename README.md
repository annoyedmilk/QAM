# QAM4 and QAM16 Modulation

## Introduction

Welcome to the QAM4 and QAM16 modulation repository, providing implementations in both C and Python. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) conveys data by changing the amplitude of two carrier waves, typically sinusoids, which are out of phase by 90¬∞.

## üìÅ Files

### C Implementations:

- `QAM4.c`: QAM4 modulation.
- `QAM16.c`: QAM16 modulation.

### Python Implementations:

- `QAM4.py`: QAM4 modulation with visualization.
- `QAM16.py`: QAM16 modulation with visualization.

## üåü Features

- **Message Encoding**: Convert string messages into I (In-phase) and Q (Quadrature) components.
- **Carrier Wave Modulation**: Modulate the I and Q components onto a carrier wave.
- **Error Simulation (Python only)**: Simulate bit errors during transmission.
- **Visualization (Python only)**: Visualize modulation, symbol errors, and waveforms.
- **Console Output**: View modulated values directly in the console.

## üöÄ Usage

### C Implementations:

1. Compilation:
   ```bash
   gcc QAM4.c -o QAM4 -lm
   gcc QAM16.c -o QAM16 -lm
   ```

2. Execution:
   ```bash
   ./QAM4
   ./QAM16
   ```

### Python Implementations:

1. Execution:
   ```bash
   python QAM4.py
   python QAM16.py
   ```

## üîç Modulation Details

- **QAM4**:
  - Process each character 2 bits at a time.
  - I and Q values: {-1, 1}

- **QAM16**:
  - Process each character 4 bits at a time.
  - I and Q values: {-3, -1, 1, 3}
